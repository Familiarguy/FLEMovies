Hi there, and thanks for applying as a frontend developer for the FLE!
In order to assess your frontend programming skills as well as your
experience with Django and Python, we've created a barebones a project
for you to show off your skills.


Within this repository's `starter/data/` folder is a `movies.json`
which is a snapshot of the Rotten Tomatoes API. Your task is to
display all the movies in a list, and allow the user to view details
of a movie once it's clicked. You can use whatever technologies and
methods you want to accomplish this task; the only requirement is to
use Django as the web framework. You can also add other features such
as search functionality or single-page view.
