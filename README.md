Hi there, and thanks for applying as a frontend developer for the FLE!
In order to assess your frontend programming skills as well as your
experience with Django and Python, we've created a barebones a project
for you to show off your skills.


Within this repository's `starter/data/` folder is a `movies.json`
which is a snapshot of the Rotten Tomatoes API. Your task is to
display all the movies in a list, and allow the user to view details
of a movie once it's clicked. You can use whatever technologies and
methods you want to accomplish this task; the only requirement is to
use Django as the web framework. You can also add other features such
as search functionality or single-page view.


So to get things started, do the following:

1. Clone this repo into your local machine (DO NOT FORK!)
2. Create a new repository in your github account
3. Change your local repository's origin remote to point to your new remote Github repository
4. Once you're satisfied with your code, push your local repository into the remote Github repository
5. Send us the link to your Github repo!


That's it! We'll review your code soon and get back to you once we're done!
